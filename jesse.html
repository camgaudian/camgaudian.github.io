          <p>Wake up to reality! Nothing ever goes as planned in this accursed world. The longer you live, the more you will realize that 
            the only things that truly exist in this reality are merely pain. Suffering and futility. Listen everywhere you look in this 
            world, wherever there is light, there will always be shadows to be found as well. As long as there is a concept of victors, 
            the vanquished will also exist. The selfish intent of wanting to preserve peace initiates war. and hatred is born in order to 
            protect love. There are nexuses casual relationships that cannot be separated.</p>
